# BFRO Data Collection Tool

The purpose of this program is to compile an offline document to parse through data obtained from https://www.bfro.net/.

The tool uses BeautifulSoup Python Libraries to parse through HTML data on the BFRO Region Reports section, which when compliled organizes the data collected from BFRO.net to list every single documented report into an easily accessable, searchable querry of reports. From which, specific keywords can be searched, and scientific data on each report can be gathered and analyzed

The ability to update the offline archive of reports by use of the program, also enables the function of constantly getting updated data as new reports arise, meaning as time goes on and assuming website doesn't change formatting, more reports and more data can be continuously added to gather a larger archive and collection of useable data.

The Software is ran in an open source PyQt5 GUI, and made as simple and easy to use as possible.

### Disclaimer

For the purposes of not unintentionally flooding BFRO with HTML pull requests, the downloading portion of the program should only be ran once.

## Requirements

You will need Python 3 installed, which can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will need BeautifulSoup installed through PIP3.

You will need PyQt5, which can also be installed through PIP3

### Updates to Come

This is a very barebones program atm, and is first software ever written, and I am learning as I go. Even this Readme is nowhere near complete or finalized.
